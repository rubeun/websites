# Rubeun's Websites

Various websites currently live.

### Bawdy Streaming

Website for my Live Streaming/Video On Demand Service for the Bawdy Storytelling monthly show.
Users can pay to watch live shows or previous shows. 
Live users can chat to each other using a simple Javascript chat feature that I coded using HTML5s SSE (Server Sent Event)

### Beats Dating

Work-in-progress dating website for the Electronic Dance Community. Users can create a profile with their preference in their matches gender, favourite electronic music genres and distance to you. 

### Rubeun.com

Website portal for both of my business websites Rubeun Tan Web Services & Burn The TV. 

### USCMC Fan Page

A small fan page dedicated to the infamous/doomed group of United States Colonial Marine Corps grunts who dared set foot on LV-246 to "rescue colonists".
Also an excuse to use Bootstrap and some Javascript animations.
